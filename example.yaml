#any entry that has sub-attributes itself is "complex", if they just have strings they are "simple"
#simple attributes are just replaced whenever thier tag appears in a base
#complex attrs can only go one deep, I did not want to handle more. 

#these are the bases that are mad-libed. use \n to make the output have a newline.
#tags are in the format of [tag], where tag is an entry elsewhere in this file
bases:
#you refer to sub elements of complex elements like below.
 - "as a [text], [name0] likes [food0dinner]. But [name1] like [food1dinner], \n and for [aftermeal], [name1] likes [food1dessert], and [name0] likes [food0dessert]"
 - "as another [text], [name1] likes [food1dinner] for [meal], and [name0] likes [food0dessert] for [aftermeal]."
 #You can use [tag-#] to make all tags with the same number be shared, and tags can use used inside other tags, to keep things together
 # in this case, this makes sure that the food chosen is of the same meal printed
 - "one final [text], [name1] likes [food1[meal-0]] for [meal-0]"
